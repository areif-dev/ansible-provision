# Personal Ansible Provisioning Tasks 

This repo provides various Ansible-Pull tasks to quickly configure my systems the way I like them

# Multiple Distro Support 

There is a branch for each distribution that I have support for. The default branch is for `rpm-ostree` based operating systems, but other supported distros include **Fedora Server**, **openSUSE Tumbleweed**, and **Archlinux**. If you want to checkout a specific branch, simply run 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/areif-dev/ansible-provision -b <branch-name>
```
